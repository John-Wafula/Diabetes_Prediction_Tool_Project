Hi John , i have an idea of a Market Gap AICE can tap in,
have You ever thought of Setting up a Robotics Processing Automation((RPA) Center with UiPath developers
either as part of AICE or a standaole, I did observe this during my days at PwC. These services are highly needed in the Market
A simple case was during the recent elections IEBC spent 7 days digitizing form 34 As manually , if they had UiPath 
developers these would have taked maximumly a day. Kenyan companies,parastatals,institutions  are producing massive amounts of Data in 
hard copy, they spend alot on money and time digitizing such documents ,these could be done my one simple RPA model built by UiPath.
Think of. 1. Insurance companies digitizing claims and client details.
        2. Hospitals digitizing patient health records 
        3.The national registrar of persons digitizing citizens data. e.t.c the applications are so many.
The applications of RPA extend to automating repetetive tasks like employees signing timesheets and hotel bookings and regisrations. Now if this
is augumented with AI we will have solutions to 90 percent of current bussiness problems.

One thing i know about the consulting market is that majority the revenue is generated from improving the current systems, minimizing
cost and increasing revenue rather than straight forward solutions. If we take a bottoms up approach model of providing solutions,we might 
tap into a huge sectorial market gap.
